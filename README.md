In this project I am developing a comprehensive Bank Loan Report, aiming to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help to make data-driven decisions, track loanâ€™s portfolio condition, and identify trends that can inform the lending strategies.  </br></br>
First, the key performance indicators will be created to present total loan applications, total funded amount, total amount received, average interest rate, and average debt-to-income ratio (DTI), together with month-to-date analysis and month-over-month changes.  </br></br>
Then the good loans and bad loans metrics will be developed, based on the loan status. Additionally, the charts presenting critical loan-related metrics and trends will be created to provide a clear and insightful view of the lending operations, enabling to gain valuable insights into various loan parameters, such as monthly trends, regional activity, loan terms, employment length, loan purpose, or home ownership.  </br></br>
Lastly, the detailed view will be enabled to provide a consolidated view of all the essential information within the loan data. It will serve as a one-stop solution for users seeking detailed insights into the loan portfolio, borrowers' profile, and loan performance.
