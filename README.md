## Summary
In this project I am developing a comprehensive Bank Loan Report, aiming to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help to make data-driven decisions, track loan’s portfolio condition, and identify trends that can inform the lending strategies.  </br></br>

## Technologies
The first step is to utilize MS SQL Server Management Studio to query the dataset and document the queries and the query results. I used the following SQL functionalities: 
- Creating database 
- SELECT 
- WHERE 
- COUNT 
- SUM 
- GROUP BY 
- ORDER BY 
- DATENAME 
- MONTH 
- YEAR 
- Aliases 
- AVG 
- ROUND 
- CASE statement 

The next step is to build visuals and a dashboard in Tableau and compare the results to the SQL queries, to ensure accuracy and correctness on created calculations. Functionalities in Tableau included: 
- Connection to the database 
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG) 
- IF statement 
- Creating Parameter 
- Creating KPI’s 
- Creating charts (Line Chart, Bar Chart, Map, Treemap, Donut Chart) 
- Formatting visuals (fonts, numbers, colors, tooltips) 
- Navigation 
- Filters 

## Skills 
With this project I showcase a range of skills essential for a data analyst role: 
- SQL Skills: the use of various SQL functionalities highlights my ability to manipulate data effectively and extract relevant information for analysis purposes. 
- Data Visualization: Through Tableau, I present my ability to create visually appealing and insightful dashboards and visualizations. This includes creating various chart types (e.g., line charts, bar charts, maps), formatting visuals, and designing dashboards for easy navigation and interpretation. 
- Analytical Skills: By developing key performance indicators (KPIs), comparing data between SQL and Tableau, and analyzing trends and patterns in loan-related metrics, I demonstrate strong analytical skills in interpreting data to derive actionable insights. 
- Communication: The project involves creating a comprehensive report that communicates insights effectively to stakeholders.
